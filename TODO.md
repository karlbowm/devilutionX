# TODO
## Done

- make a function that takes cxx data and does something eg cxx<->rust *WARNING*: 
- fix build currently when we change rust lib, we need to delete the rust_devil.h/cpp in the build folder so the project rebuilds propperly, maybe https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion  could help simplify it and make it easier with https://github.com/geekbrother/cxx-corrosion-cmake as a reference
